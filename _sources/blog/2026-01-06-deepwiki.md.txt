# TorchFX is now indexed on DeepWiki

I’m happy to share a small but meaningful update for the TorchFX project.

Thanks to the contribution of **kaigouthro**, TorchFX is now **indexed on DeepWiki**, making the library more accessible to anyone interested in understanding its design, usage, or contributing to its development.

## TorchFX on DeepWiki

DeepWiki offers an alternative, structured way to explore open-source projects, focusing on documentation, code organization, and conceptual clarity. Being indexed there is a great opportunity for:

- new users who want to explore TorchFX before diving into the code,
- researchers looking for differentiable audio DSP tools,
- contributors who want a high-level overview of the project structure.

You can find TorchFX on DeepWiki here:

- 👉 [https://deepwiki.com/matteospanio/torchfx](https://deepwiki.com/matteospanio/torchfx)

## Downloadable Documentation Dump

In addition to the online index, a **local dump of the DeepWiki documentation** is available.  
This can be useful for offline exploration, archival purposes, or experimentation.

The documentation dump is available in the following branch:

- 👉 [https://github.com/kaigouthro/torchfx/tree/deepwiki-01-2026](https://github.com/kaigouthro/torchfx/tree/deepwiki-01-2026)

## A Community-Driven Improvement

This update is a great example of how community contributions can improve a project in ways that go beyond code alone. Better visibility and alternative documentation formats make TorchFX easier to approach, understand, and extend.

Many thanks to [https://github.com/kaigouthro](https://github.com/kaigouthro) for the contribution!

As always, feedback and contributions are welcome — whether they come in the form of code, documentation, or ideas.
