# TorchFX roadmap and documentation update

As interest in TorchFX continues to grow within the audio and research community, it became clear that the documentation needed to evolve alongside the project.

To better support users, developers, and contributors, I’ve carried out a **documentation refresh** focused on clarity, structure, and long-term sustainability.

## What’s New

### 📘 Guides

The documentation now includes a dedicated **Guides** section, designed to explain:
- how TorchFX works internally,
- the core design ideas behind the library,
- recommended usage patterns for both users and developers.

The goal is to make TorchFX easier to approach, without hiding the underlying concepts.

### 🧩 Improved API Reference

The **API reference** has been reorganized and is now clearly divided by **modules**, making it easier to navigate, understand, and extend the library.

### 📰 Blog Section

A new **Blog** section has been added to the documentation.  
This space will be used for announcements, project updates, and general communications related to TorchFX.

### 🤝 Contributing Guide

For those interested in getting involved, I’ve added a **contribution guide** (`CONTRIBUTING.md`) in the root of the repository.  
It explains how to contribute, propose changes, and collaborate on the project in a structured way.

### 🛣️ Project Roadmap

Finally, a **roadmap** is now available to better organize and communicate the future development of TorchFX.  
This helps align expectations and provides a clearer picture of where the project is heading.

## Looking Ahead

This documentation update is a foundation for the next phase of TorchFX.  
As the project grows, the documentation will continue to improve with feedback from the community.

Thank you to everyone who has shown interest so far — your curiosity and engagement are what make open-source research projects like this possible.
